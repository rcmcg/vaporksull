# VAPORKSULL
This Android game is a minesweeper-type game where the goal is to find all the skulls on the board by checking the smallest amount of squares. Selecting a square without a skull will perform a scan, revealing a number which is a count of the combined sum of all hidden skulls in that square's row and column. Selecting a square with a skull will reveal the skull and update the count for any scanned squares in that square's row and column.

If you would like to try the game yourself you can clone the repo into Android Studio and run an emulator on Pixel 2 API 29. You can also install through USB on your own device through Android Studio although the app hasn't been tested on a wide range of devices, the one I am using is a Samsung S9+.

Here is a short video walking through the game (44s, no audio): https://youtu.be/_lehkXuS_nI
